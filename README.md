This repository contains the source code for my React San Diego Tops.

Objectives:

- Include CSS styling provided by Bootstrap.
- Create a container component to manage application state.
- Create a (stateless function) presentational component to render a collection of 30 San Diego Top Spots.

The purpose of this project was to identify and create all the different components, establish an interactive user interface and then handle all the failures, crashes, and bugs.

Steps Taken:

1. Clone a set of files from GitHub.
2. Implement CSS styling provided by Bootstrap.
3. Write JSX to render a page header and subtitle.
4. Create a container component to utilize a web service for the data (an array of objects) it exposes.
5. Create a constructor to set an initial state object.
6. Add a lifecycle method to utilize Axios, make an HTTP request from Node when the component mounts, and store that data in an Axios object.
7. Render a list of presentational components by mapping out a more human readable version of the Axios object.
